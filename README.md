* You can find all the step to build this boat on this [article](https://blog.recast.ai/rpg-bot-star-wars/)


## Set up your Recast.AI account

##### Create your bot

* Log in to your Recast.AI account
* Create a new bot

##### Get your token

* In your profile, click your bot
* In the tab-menu, click on the the little screw
* Here is the `request access token` you will need to configure your bot!

## Create your bot on Bot Connector

* Bot Connector allows you to connect your bot to multiple channels at the same time with only one API integration.
* Create a new account on Bot Connector or use your Recast.AI account

* Letâ€™s start by creating a new bot, pick a name you like.
* To create the URL of you bot, create a webhook. That will create a tunnel from your bot to Bot Connector. Weâ€™re using a ngrok webhook, but you can use any kind of webhook you like.
* if you donâ€™t have ngrok, check [this](https://ngrok.com/download) out to get started.

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

* Nice, you now have a first version of your bot! Now, letâ€™s connect it to channels.

* Bot Connector has two main zones:

 * in the orange selection, pick the channel you want

 * in the purple selection, configure your integration

* In this tutorial, weâ€™ll cover the Messenger integration, feel free to discover Slack and Kik on your own. ðŸ™‚

* So, you need two things: your page token and your app token.
* Youâ€™ll find you page token here:
* https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR-APP-ID/messenger/
* and your app token here:
* https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR-APP-ID/dashboard/
* After adding your channel, the connector will send you back a url and a webhook token. Put those information in the Facebook Developer page.
